## **Question 15: Characteristics of public cloud ? (Domain Area 2)**

The one of two main characteristics of the public cloud are:
- metered pricing
- self-serivce management

## **Theory: Understanding public, private and hybrid. (Domain Area 2)**

**Public cloud** - It's about when you are going to use some ready-made cloud out there like Amazon CLoud or Azure Cloud, you know that the hardware is bought by Nicrosoft and as an organization you just go and use it through the Internet and it doesn't matter it is PAy-As-You-Go or it's metered, everithing is taken care of by them.

**Private cloud** - It means the infrastructure of your own organization and the cloud is looked after by the organization, that organization decided hardware, SLA and responsibilities.

**Hybrid Cloud** - It's about when you want to take benefits all of the above. E.g. the data is very sensitive and you don't want to host everything online so some of the data can be placed in organization's own Data Center and other data can be hoosted in the public cloud like Azure or Amazon.

## **Question 16: Adding extra resources recommend solution. (Domain Area 2)**

If you need an on-premises network contains lots of servers and you need to recommend a solution provides additional resources to your users and that solution have to minimize capital and operational expenditure costs, you shall recommend **a hybrid cloud** because solutions like a complete migration to the public cloud or an additional data center is extremely expensive.

## **Question 17: Identifying the benefit of public cloud service. (Domain Area 2)**

If you plan to migrate several servers from an local network to Azure and you need to identify the primary benefit of using a public cloud service for the servers you can identify:

- The public cloud is a shared entity whereby multiple corporations each use a portion of the resources in the cloud.

## **Question 18: Extending capacity by using public cloud. (Domain Area 2)**

To achieve a hybrid cloud model, a company shouldn't always migrate from a private cloud model.

A company can extend the capacity of its internal network by using the public cloud but in this case the network will become a hybrid type network.

In a public cloud model guest users at your company can't access the resources in the cloud dut to security reasons.

## **Question 19: Can private cloud run with out data center ? (Domain Area 2)**

If an organization hosts its infrastructure in a public cloud can decommission its data center with the following instructiuons.
